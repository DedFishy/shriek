A simple text messaging program to replace Discord when it inevitably sucks.

## Usage
### Client
Simply download this repo and run `client.py` with your favorite Python interpreter. It should automatically install its dependencies. If you don't have a server to connect to, try to use `iamdying.boyne.dev`, and if it happens to be running you'll be in the clear.
### Server
Simply run `server.py` with your favorite Python interpreter. It has no dependencies you need to install.

## Will this actually replace Discord?
No. Use something that has voice calling. UDP is hard, man.
